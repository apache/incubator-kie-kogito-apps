# Kogito persistence commons

This is the module that provides the persistence abstraction for the kogito apps. 

It is composed by the following modules:

1) `persistence-commons-api` contains the interfaces `Storage` and `StorageService` that the consumer has to inject in his application. In addition to that, it contains the interface `Query` that the consumer has to use to query the storage.
2) `persistence-commons-protobuf` contains the `ProtobufService` that the consumer can use to manage his protobuf schemas.
3) `persistence-commons-redis` contains all the classes to manage redis as persistence layer. See [here](./persistence-commons-redis/README.md) for the complete list of supported operations.

## How to use it

The consumer has to 

1) Inject the `StorageService` bean where needed, and the implementation will be selected using the property `kogito.apps.persistence.type`.
2) Create one module for each supported storage type, add the custom codecs (for mongo for example).
3) For protobuf, provide a `ProtostreamProducer` as shown [here](../data-index/data-index-storage/data-index-storage-protobuf/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/index/protobuf/ProtostreamProducer.java) .
