# Kogito persistence commons

This is the module that provides the persistence abstraction for the kogito apps. 

It is composed by three modules: 

1) `persistence-commons-api` contains the interfaces `Storage` and `StorageService` that the consumer has to inject in his application. In addition to that, it contains the interface `Query` that the consumer has to use to query the storage. 
2) `persistence-commons-infinispan` contains all the classes to manage infinispan as persistence layer. 
3) `persistence-commons-protobuf` contains the `ProtobufService` that the consumer can use to manage his protobuf schemas. 

## How to use it

The consumer has to 

1) Inject the `StorageService` bean where needed, and the implementation will be selected using the property `kogito.persistence.type`. 
2) Create one module for each supported storage type, add the custom marshallers (for infinispan) or the custom codecs (for mongo for example). See [here](../data-index/data-index-storage/data-index-storage-infinispan/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/index/infinispan/protostream/ProtostreamProducer.java)  for an example.
3) For protobuf, provide a `ProtostreamProducer` as shown [here](../data-index/data-index-storage/data-index-storage-protobuf/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/index/protobuf/ProtostreamProducer.java) .
