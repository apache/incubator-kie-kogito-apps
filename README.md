- Install Node and NPM package manager

See detailed instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for your OS.

- Install [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
```bash
cd kogito-apps/ui-packages
npm install -g pnpm
```

```bash
cd kogito-apps/ui-packages

```

> Final artifacts will be on `packages/*/dist` directories.

## Management Console

For detailed instructions on how to develop and run the Management Console, please check instructions on the specific 
[README](./ui-packages/packages/management-console/README.md) file.

## `ui-packages` dependencies

`ui-packages` are managed with [Pnpm Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). Dependencies shared between packages are listed in the top-level [`package.json`](./ui-packages/package.json).

A `locktt` npm script relying on [lock-treatment-tool](https://github.com/Ginxo/lock-treatment-tool) is available to allow the usage of a private npm registry during building.

`locktt` replaces the host from [`ui-packages/pnpm-lock`](./ui-packages/pnpm-lock) resolved field with the custom registry. It is set to run just before the execution of `pnpm install`. See [`ui-packages/pom.xml`](./ui-packages/pom.xml) for further details.

## Skipping frontend build

To skip the frontend build when running maven, simply execute Maven with the following parameters

```bash
mvn clean install -Dskip.ui.build -Dskip.ui.deps
```
