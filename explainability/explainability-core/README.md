# explainability-core project

The explainability-core project is a pure Java library for _Explainability_ (aka _XAI_ or _Explainable AI_).

It provides implementation of the following algorithms:

 * Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
   * a modified version of the [LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) algorithm (Ribeiro et al., 2016) for local explanations.
 * Constrainsts-based counterfactual search
 * Partial Dependence Plot: an implementation of the [PDP](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2699986) algorithm (Friedman et al., 2001) for global explanations.
