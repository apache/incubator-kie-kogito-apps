# This file contains the default configurations for the Quarkus http connector.

# Job status change events notification disabled by default
kogito.jobs-service.http.job-status-change-events=false

# Job status change events are automatically enabled with the profile: http-events-support (-Dquarkus.profile=http-events-support)
%http-events-support.kogito.jobs-service.http.job-status-change-events=true

# Unlike the smallrye-kafka connector, quarkus-http connector doesn't have a way to disable an incoming connector at runtime.
# So by now, similar to REST API, the http eventing API is always enabled.
# Future work might introduce a http-events-support.kogito.jobs-service.http.events-api=true/false property do disable http eventing API dynamically.
