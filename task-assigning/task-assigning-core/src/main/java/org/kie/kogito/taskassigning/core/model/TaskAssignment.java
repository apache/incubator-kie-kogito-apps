/**
 * TaskAssignment is the only planning entity that will be changed during the problem solving, and we have only one
 * PlanningVariable.
 * <p>
 * In this particular problem we want to do the assignments in a way that the list of tasks
 * for a given user is ordered. (see e.g. that Higher priority tasks must be resolved first is a soft constraint)
 * <p>
 * User1: A <- B <- C <- D
 * <p>
 * User2: E <- F
 * <p>
 * The initial task of each sequence points to the user that will own all the tasks in the list, so when a solution is
 * created we'll have something like this.
 * <p>
 * User1 <- A <- B <- C <- D (In this example, User1 is the anchor)
 * <p>
 * This explains why property "previousElement" can be assigned with User or a TaskAssignment.
 * <p>
 * BUT the solver builds the solutions in a way that only the first item of the "chain" points to
 * a user. This is how a CHAINED configuration works. And the way the solver knows which must be the fact class
 * that must be used for setting the previousElement property is by considering the order in the PlanningVariable
 * configuration.
 * 
 * @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"userRange", "taskRange"}, graphType = PlanningVariableGraphType.CHAINED)
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          Here we basically declared that we want to build a CHAINED graph but also since the "userRange" is the first
 *                                          valueRangeProviderRef we are declaring that the User will be used as anchor.
 *                                          So the solver will always start by using an User as the head of the list and then it'll consider adding Tasks
 *                                          to the linked structure.
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          Additionally for the calculation of the scores, etc, given a TaskAssignment of a particular solution we'll want to know quickly
 *                                          which is the User that was assigned to this task.
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          If we have the following chain
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          Employee1 (the anchor) <- A <- B <- C <- D
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          and we take e.g. D, then to get the assigned Employee1 the list must be iterated, but this probably not the best idea.
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          Solution, add a shadow variable and let the solver populate this variable when the solution is constructed.
 *                                          With the declaration below a shadow variable is defined for keeping a reference to the anchor. This shadow variable
 *                                          is populated and kept consistent by the solver.
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          Shadow variable:
 *                                          Let all Tasks have a reference to the anchor of the chain, the assigned user.
 * @AnchorShadowVariable(sourceVariableName = "previousElement")
 *                                          private User user;
 *                                          <p>
 *                                          CustomShadowVariable startTimeInMinutes:
 *                                          Convenient shadow variable is declared for having the startTimeInMinutes of a task already calculated.
 * @CustomShadowVariable(variableListenerClass = StartAndEndTimeUpdatingVariableListener.class,
 *                                             sources = {@PlanningVariableReference(variableName = "previousElement")})
 *                                             private Integer startTimeInMinutes;
 *                                             <p>
 *                                             So the variableListenerClass is invoked when the source variable is changed/assigned.
